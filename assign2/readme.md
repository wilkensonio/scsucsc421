# Assignment2

1. Write a definition of a function called `add`. It should take two Integers ($a$ and $b$) as inputs and an Integer as the output. The result should be the addition of two input numbers ($a+b$).
1. Write a definition of a function called `double`. It should take one Integer as the input (n) and an Integer as the output. The function should double the value of the input value $n$, which is $2n$.
1. Write a definition of a function called `area` to calculate the area of a circle. It should take one Float as the input (r) and a Float as the output.

1. Write a definition of a function called `cube` to calculate the cube of an input $n$. Both input and output types are Integer.
1. Write a definition of a function to double the area of a circle. The function only takes one Float input. You should reuse the function `area` you defined.
1. Write a definition of a function called `cylinder` to calculate the volume of a cylinder. The function takes two input, a Float (r) and a height (h). You should reuse the function `area` you defined.
1. Write a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. It takes a Float input (c) and produces a Float output (f). (Formula: $(c\times 9/5)+32$.)
1. Give another version of the definition of **exclusive or** which works informally like this: exclusive or of x and y will be True if either x is True and y is False, or x is False and y is True.
1. Give two different definitons of the `nAnd` function:

   ```
   nAnd :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
   ```

   which returns the result True except when both its arguments are True.

1. Write a function `min` to find the minimum number of two given numbers. The function take two integers as input and return an integer as output.
